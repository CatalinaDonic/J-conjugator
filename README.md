# J-conjugator
A python-based tool that conjugates Japanese verbs into different forms (polite, negative, past) and presents a quiz to help users test their knowledge.

# Introduction
Japanese verbs have multiple forms that vary based on tense, politeness level and context. Conjugation is challenging, essential yet complex skill for learners. To aid in this process, we introduce "J-conjugator", which will serve as an interactive platform to help learners practice conjugating verbs. It features a database of commonly used basic verbs, user-friendly interface and an engaging quiz to make learning both effective and fun.
